//! - [`tts`] - Kokoro, through sherpa-onnx, turns typed narration into a

/// Kokoro and Pocket run through sherpa's own runtime, which k2-fsa builds
/// for the CPU there, so they stay on it. Linux has no accelerator in the
/// runtime the app ships. Not a setting. Measured on an M5 against
/// the CPU, a warm read took 10.3 s against 14.8 for Kokoro (and came out
/// sample for sample the same), 5.6 against 6.5 for Pocket and 48.6
/// against 60.6 for Chatterbox. The one cost is Chatterbox's load, about
/// eleven seconds longer while CoreML compiles its networks, paid once per
/// run since the engine stays loaded. A model that will not load for CoreML
/// at all loads for the CPU instead (tts.rs).
